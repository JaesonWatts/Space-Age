# Space Age

## Overview

Space Age is an app that allows you to enter your birthdate and a birthday card taken on that date will render to the page. You can also view more images that were taken on you birth date. We used vue.js to create this application.


## Learning Goals

Incorporating a new technology into our application that isnâ€™t explicitly taught will give us the opportunity to differentiate ourselves from other Turing grads and give a great story to tell in the job interview - employers love to hear about experiences being self driven and learning new technologies outside of the standard Turing curriculum.
