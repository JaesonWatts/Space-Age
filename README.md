# Space Age

## Overview

Space Age is an app that allows you to enter your name and a birthdate. An image that was taken on that date will render to the page in the form of a card with additional information in regards to the image. You can also view more images that were taken the week of your birthday. We used vue.js to create this application.


## Learning Goals

Incorporating a new technology into our application that isnâ€™t explicitly taught will give us the opportunity to differentiate ourselves from other Turing grads and give a great story to tell in the job interview - employers love to hear about experiences being self driven and learning new technologies outside of the standard Turing curriculum.
